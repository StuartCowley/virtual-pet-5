## Description

This project creates and runs a virtual pet.

The virtual pet can be named. Let's call them Bobbie for now.

Bobbie will age. As Bobbie ages, they will become hungry and they will lose fitness.
Fortunately, Bobbie can be taken on walks to to increase their fitness. 🏃‍♂️

Bobbie can also be fed to decrease their hunger. 🍕

You can talk to Bobbie to see they need feeding or walking

If Bobbie gets too hungry or unfit, they will DIE 💀

If Bobbie gets to 30 days old they will DIE 😢
